An Honest Look at Independence
 
Time: 2:30 PM, Room: 270

Speaker Jim Christopher  Bio

Details: It’s rare to have a true employer these days – instead developers race to project deadlines, after which their future is up in the air. A growing number of developers are steering themselves into careers of independent consulting and software development. In an hour session, we will explore my story of independence – the glorious benefits of the freedom and the terrifying responsibility that is all a part of running your own life. In particular, we’ll see how being independent has almost nothing to do with my work and career and everything to do with my attitude and choices. This talk will include: A close look at the financial impact of becoming my own boss; The psychological ups and downs of running my own life; The difficult (and sometimes moronic) choices I’ve been forced to make; Discussion of the legal responsibilities I took on when starting my business; How I get to spend a typical day at the “noffice”. Going independent isn’t a panacea to your career woes, it’s a compromise like everything else. It is a wonderful lifestyle, provided you understand what you’re getting into.

Asynchronous Programming in .Net
 
Time: 9:00 AM, Room: 265

Speaker Steve Willoughby  Bio

Details: Asynchronous programming is a complex topic. On top of the moving pieces in the operating system that make it work, there is a large list of terminology and potential pitfalls. But armed with some concepts and a working knowledge of the .Net syntax, you can be productive in asynchronous programming in pretty short order. We'll cover the basics about Thread Safety, Data Parallelism, and Task Parallelism as implemented in the .Net 4.5 Framework and pick apart a number of code samples. Along the way, we'll discuss when async is a good idea and when it should be avoided. If you're new to threading, this should give you a good jumpstart. If you're an old hand, please come and share your experience. We'll pack as much of this fascinating topic into an hour as we can!

Build a MVC eCommerce Site in Under 5 Minutes
 
Time: 4:00 PM, Room: 255

Speaker Gaines Kergosien  Bio

Details: For those of us who have spent most of our careers building business applications, the prospect of creating an e-commerce storefront can be quite daunting. Not only do you have to deal with calculating tax, estimating shipping and accepting payments, but employees need a way to manage products, discounts and marketing content. Thankfully, there's an open source e-commerce solution written in Microsoft ASP.NET MVC named nopCommerce that provides all this functionality and much more. I was so impressed by both the functionality and the underlying architecture that I've created a presentation which I believe will serve as a great introduction to MVC as well as a tutorial on developing custom storefronts using nopCommerce. We start off with a brief overview of basic MVC concepts accompanied by examples within the nopCommerce code. This includes strongly typed Razor views, HTML helpers, jQuery ajax calls, and fluent validation. Once everyone understands how the website works, we dive into the infrastructure by introducing WCF services, using a generic repository with Entity Framework(EF4) and LINQ, as well as Dependency Injection (DI) with Automapper.

Building Real Time Web Applications with SignalR
 
Time: 1:00 PM, Room: 235

Speaker Kevin Griffin  Bio

Details: In the beginning, we had static websites. Then we invented AJAX, and our websites became alive with dynamic content. Now we're getting to a point where we'd like to have our web applications work in cool asynchronous ways across all of it's connected users. The typically example would be a chat room. You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room. In the past, in order to build a system like that took time and code. How about dynamically refreshing content in your application based on events that happen on the server? SignalR is a library that assists you in building real-time, multi-user interactive web applications. In this talk, we'll discuss the current state of the real time web, and then WOW you with quick, easy, and code-filled demos showing off the power of SignalR.

Introduction to F#
 
Time: 1:00 PM, Room: 265

Speaker Jamie Dixon  Bio

Details: Back in 2010, Visual Studio shipped with a new language on board: F#.  F# is a fantastic language - it mixes functional and Object Oriented approaches seamlessly, encourages writing bug-free code, comes with great features, and is incredibly productive.  Recently, I partnered with an Actuarial department to do an app using F# and R to do some real-time statistical analysis and have it seamlessly integrate into a .NET application.  The results are pretty amazing – an end-to-end Line Of Business app that combines the statistical power and speed of R with the productivity, reusability, and rapid development of the .NET stack.   For the C#/VB.NET developer accustomed to Object Oriented thinking, F# can be a bit daunting at first.  The session’s goal is to get you over that initial shock and awe of working with a functional language.  This talk will focus on F# with an emphasis of real-world examples to show you its awesomeness.   It assumes no prior experience with F# or functional languages.
